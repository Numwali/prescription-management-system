General Project Description of The AFYA BORA APP

1. The AFYA BORA APP represents a groundbreaking Python software solution that revolutionizes how users access medical treatment and prescriptions promptly, without the hassle of waiting for a doctor's appointment. This innovative application is designed with user convenience, offering a seamless experience for individuals seeking medical assistance across various specialities, including Gynecology, internal medicine, surgery, and paediatrics. The app intelligently guides users towards the most suitable course of action based on their unique medical needs by harnessing the power of advanced A.I. algorithms.

2. The AFYA BORA APP is structured in a tiered system that caters to users of all levels of medical knowledge, from beginners to experts. This tiered approach ensures that individuals receive personalized and comprehensive medical support, allowing them to navigate the application at their own pace. As users progress through different difficulty levels, they are presented with increasingly complex medical scenarios, enabling them to enhance their understanding of various health conditions while effectively addressing their concerns.

3. Within the AFYA BORA APP, users are prompted to select their preferred department, such as Gynecology, internal medicine, surgery, or paediatrics, to begin their medical journey. The application records the patient's diagnostic history within the chosen speciality, facilitating a thorough comparison of diagnoses and treatments with previous cases. By analyzing similarities with past clinical cases, the app can provide users with tailored treatment recommendations based on proven medical practices, ensuring optimal care and outcomes for each individual. 

4. To ensure the seamless functionality of the AFYA BORA APP, several key features and functions will be implemented. These include an introductory function that familiarises users with the app's rules and guidelines, a problem display function that presents medical scenarios to users, an input validation function that confirms the correctness of user inputs, and a verification function that checks the accuracy of user responses. By incorporating these essential elements, the AFYA BORA APP will deliver a user-friendly and effective platform for accessing prompt medical treatment and prescriptions.
